# CS Study : Computer Science

Notes and HW files for Computer Science lectures that I studied alone.

I am Mechanical Engineering Student in Korea University, and I REALLY HATE MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.

I don't want to be ignored because I am a non-major developer, so I study CS courses and post the contents here.
